## pod security admission standard

By default, this cluster is using the level = `restricted` for all 3 modes = `enforce`, `audit`, and `warn`.
Every namespace receives this level unless explicity overridden.

## kustomize patches

Uses JSON6902 style most of the time. Argocd uses strategic merge patches as well.
